  <h1>FINITE GROUP THEORY, Second Edition</h1>
  <h2>M. ASCHBACHER</h2>
  

  <p>An algebraic structure is a set with defined operations on its elements.</p>
  
  <p>An algebraic structure with one operation, which acts on two elements, is said to be a group if it satisfies the below conditions:
  <br><y> The operation is restricted to the set.</y>
  <br><y> There exists an element in the set that acts as a global identity.</y>
  <br><y>  For every element in the set, there is an element in the set that acts as its inverse.</y>
  <br><y>  The operation is associative.</y></p>
  
  <p>The order of a group G is an integer, and is denoted |G|. It is the cardinality of its underlying set.</p>
  
  <p>G is said to be a finite group if its order is finite.</p>
  
  <p>G is said to be an abelian group if every element commutes with every other element.</p>
