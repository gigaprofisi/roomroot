const frankel1 = `"Well, if I really were to assign blame
I would assign the blame to myself, and my colleagues, professional mathematicians.
We don't do nearly enough exposing these ideas to the public in an accessible way.
Often times we are not willing to come up with good metaphors and analogies
And this is how science should be communicated
You have to communicate science in a way that's creative, that links to something people already know
We are not doing nearly enough

And I don't want that to continue.
I want everyone in on the secret. I want everyone to realize there is this beautiful world out there, which is so important for our daily lives
Which posesses this unparalleled power and beauty.
We have to convey this idea. We have to find ways to convey those ideas.
Why has it not already happened? Well sometimes I wonder myself, why has it not already happened.
It's almost a conspiracy... It's almost like there's a system of mirrors which distorts reality
which does not allow most people to see what is out there
And lets face it, how many more things are left to discover?
There is this beautiful world out there, and you don't even have to travel anywhere to find it.
It's right at your fingertips.
Wouldn't you want to go and find out more about it?

This is the coolest stuff in the world.
And yet everyone hates it. Isn't it ironic?"
