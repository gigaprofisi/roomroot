Let ꟻ be the set of all ordered pairs of signed finite ℚ, adjoined with a unique infinity element.
  ꟻ := {∀ab ∈ ℚ : (a,b)} ∪ (∞,∞)
Elements of ꟻ have two parts, x and y, and are identified by
juxtaposition. (For example, P ∈ ꟻ : P=(5,2), then Px=5, Py=2.)



No new operations are defined on elements ꟻ. Only new elements are constructed from operations on the individual coordinates over ℚ.



An elliptic curve 𝔼(a,b) is defined over P ∈ ꟻ, with constants ab ∈ ℚ. It
is the subset of all ꟻ that satisfies Px^3 + aPx + b - Py^2 = 0.

b is a free constant, so the space 𝔼(a) 


------

For arbitrary finite unique A, B ∈ ꟻ, there is exactly one elliptic
curve 𝔼(a,b) that passes through A,B.

ℚ

the identity ∞ := ( ∞, ∞ )

the inverse operation ∼ A := ( Ax, -Ay )

the binary operation A ⊙ B :=
  if A≠B: (
    ((Ay - By)/(Ax - Bx))^2 - Ax - Bx,
    (((Ay - By)/(Ax - Bx))^2 - 2Ax - Bx)(Ay - By)/(Ax - Bx) + Ay
  )
  if A=B: (
    ((3Ax^2 + a)/(2Ay))^2 - 2Ax,
    ((3Ax^2 + a)/(2Ay))^3 - 3(3Ax^3 + aAx)/(2Ay) + Ay
  )

And with some defined edge cases regarding the identity,
  ∞⊙∞ = ∞
  ∼∞ = ∞

One can verify that if A,B ∈ 𝔼(a), then ∼A and A⊙B are unique valid elements of 𝔼(a).

The algebraic structure (ꟻ, ∞, ∼p, p⊙q) forms an abelian group under 𝔼(a).


For the A≠B case of ⊙, notice that the constant "a" is not present.
It would be convenient if this were true generally, but unfortunately,
the edge case A⊙A requires this constant to be present due to the
existence of multiple valid limit points.



Under the geometric definition of ⊙, it is perfectly acceptible: just
take the limit along the curve. This is not possible without defining the
elliptic curve initially, as the field is not singular at every point.
